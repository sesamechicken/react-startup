# React Startup
This Fusion repo is a very small starting point for those wishing to dive into a React app, or use for boilerplate for a different project.

Code is commented thoroughly, and pull requests are welcomed! :)

## Running the app
Clone this repo to your machine. In a terminal window, enter the new project's directory and run `yarn` against it. Yarn will install all dev and prod dependencies.

After Yarn has finsihed, run `yarn start` to start the dev server. This project uses HMR (Hot Module Reloading), so you can make code changes and the server will pick them up, run through webpack, and refresh the view in the browser.

## Contributing
Please create a branch off of `master` and submit a Pull Request through Bitbucket. Contributions to help everyone learn something new are always welcomed!
