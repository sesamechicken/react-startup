# Starter React App

Vanilla React app that can be hosted easily on Github or your server!

- No crazy dependency list
- Uses a minimal Webpack config
- No voodoo or black magic to build
- Testing requirements set up - start writing unit tests immediately
- Small and disposable!

## Running

```js
yarn dev // 🛠 run in dev mode. You probably want this first
yarn test // 🃏 run the unit tests with Jest
yarn lint // ✨ run eslint against the project with some basic rules
yarn build // 🏗 webpack build
```
